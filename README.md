Goal of this project is to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front facing camera on a car. 
- Camera calibration was done first to correct the distortion introduced in the image by lens.
- Sobel operator was used to identify the lane lines in an image.
- Perspective transformation was done to get top view of the image.
- A histogram is used to identify the pixels which form part of the lane.
- Detailed project writeup can be found [here](https://github.com/suji0131/Advanced_Lane_Detection/blob/master/writeup.md) and final video output can be found [here](https://github.com/suji0131/Advanced_Lane_Detection/blob/master/project_video_final.mp4).
